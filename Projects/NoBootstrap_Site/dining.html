        <p>THE Pub to go to in Pensacola, it honestly is the most iconic one I can think of in the city. With tons of great food and drinks, as well as being open PRETTY late for all you night owls, this is the place to go for a bite to eat and a good time.

        <p>Personally, I love this place, it is a great sports bar with plenty of televisions of the games and great food! Plus, it's on the beach so you can enjoy the area afterwards. To visit the Sidelines website, <a href="https://sidelinespensacola.com/">Click here.</a></p><br>

        <p>I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but I can say that every time I go here, it's what I get; best place for the view and seafood hands down. It also has bands playing outside all the time and volleyball courts as well as a park for the kids. To visit the Flounder's website, <a href="http://www.cordovalanes.com/">Click here.</a></p><br>
